<h3>Courses</h3>
<h5>2020</h5>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZCDxZ44o4p3N5Anz3lLRVZF">DeepMind's UCL course lectures</a> went live on June 1. Apparently really good for intuition and recent research from the first looks of it as I can already see papers cited from 2020. Will keep you posted as I go through the videos one by one later this week Inshallah.<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZCDxZ44o4p3N5Anz3lLRVZF">Introduction to Deep Leaning</a> went live in February 2020. This series of lectures gives you an amazing perspective on cutting edge research with regards to reinforcement learning and some of the other relevant domains that are more au courant these days. More importantly, I found them to be really eye-opening in terms of the more daunting challenges such as Scent Detection, AGI and the likes. impact I wasn't able to spare time to watch the Reinforcement part though but I will return back to it once I have the time.<br>

<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/learn/lecture/6743222?start=0#overview">Deep Learning A-Z</a> is a comprehensive course for deep learning enthusiasts. I would say it is more for beginners rather than experts, but with a video content of over 20 hours, it touches many aspects of the practical side of deep learning with Tensorflow and related frameworks.<br><br>


<h3>Youtube Channels</h3>
<p>I know that this is a lot to process here. One can never keep track of everything and the landscape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZZjaYl4AA">keeps shifting</a> but I am nonetheless, going to go ahead and create this list of some of the most amazing videos/channels on YouTube that have helped me throughout my difficult times.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA">Computerphile<a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown<a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Benchmark Websites</h3>
While researching for some stuff, I stumbled accross these websites that provide with an excellent resource to track benchmark results down, sometimes with the code link on GitHub too. <br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers with Code</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ai-benchmark.com/">AI Benchmark</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Papers</h3>
<h5>Image Recognition</h5>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12320.pdf">Learning To Classify Images Without Labels</a> A seminal paper on Image Recognition that I believe will make waves throughout the research community in the coming years. They have beaten the SOTA methods by a margin of over 20% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100-20 datasets.<br><br>
