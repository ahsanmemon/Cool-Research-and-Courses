<h3>Courses</h3>
<h5>2020</h5>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZCDxZ44o4p3N5Anz3lLRVZF">DeepMind's UCL course lectures</a> went live on June 1. Apparently really good for intuition and recent research from the first looks of it as I can already see papers cited from 2020. Will keep you posted as I go through the videos one by one later this week Inshallah.<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZCDxZ44o4p3N5Anz3lLRVZF">Introduction to Deep Leaning</a> went live in February 2020. This series of lectures gives you an amazing perspective on cutting edge research with regards to reinforcement learning and some of the other relevant domains that are more au courant these days. More importantly, I found them to be really eye-opening in terms of the more daunting challenges such as Scent Detection, AGI and the likes. impact I wasn't able to spare time to watch the Reinforcement part though but I will return back to it once I have the time.<br>

<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/learn/lecture/6743222?start=0#overview">Deep Learning A-Z</a> is a comprehensive course for deep learning enthusiasts. I would say it is more for beginners rather than experts, but with a video content of over 20 hours, it touches many aspects of the practical side of deep learning with Tensorflow and related frameworks.<br>

<h5>2017</h5>
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">deeplearning.ai</a>'s flagship course that I feel is one of the best courses out there about deep learning. I think this course builds the foundations of deep leanring really well but one needs to do a tensorflow/keras/pytorch specialzation on top of it to really be able to implement this knowledge in the market.<br>


<h3>Youtube Channels</h3>
<p>I know that this is a lot to process here. One can never keep track of everything and the landscape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZZjaYl4AA">keeps shifting</a> but I am nonetheless, going to go ahead and create this list of some of the most amazing videos/channels on YouTube that have helped me throughout my difficult times.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA">Computerphile<a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown<a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Benchmark Websites</h3>
While researching for some stuff, I stumbled accross these websites that provide with an excellent resource to track benchmark results down, sometimes with the code link on GitHub too. <br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers with Code</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ai-benchmark.com/">AI Benchmark</a></li>

<h3>Repos</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research">Tensorflow Research Repo</a> is an amazing repo that gives you access to implementations of some of the more advanced models out there in the market. These include many algorithms that are not available at the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials">Tensorflow Tutorials</a> webpage.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials">Tensorflow Tutorials</a> are more for people who have just finished basic Tensorflow courses and are now ready to delve into more complex architectures that are seldom covered in those courses. They are really useful if you want to implement certain functionality out of the box. However, I did not find them easy to understand because they use Tensorflow almost completely (for performance reasons). Nonetheless, they are great for out-of-the-box implementations.<br><br>
